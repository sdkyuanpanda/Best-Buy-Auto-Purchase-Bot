Make sure to have a Bestbuy Account, you only need to enter your Credit Card CVV because you already have your credit card saved in your account.

Bestbuy is really annoying, for the go to cart button finder step, bestbuy keeps changing the button type. That's why I included 3 types of button finders: X-Path, CSS_Selector, and class. Be sure to check the class of each button before using the bot, otherwise your gpu will go bye-bye. Don't worry about the wait part, it's a really dumb way to bypass bestbuys anti-bot "please-wait" step.
